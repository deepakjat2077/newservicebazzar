    |
    | - "autoOrientation" controls whether an imported image should be
    |    automatically rotated according to any existing Exif data.
    |
    | - "decodeAnimation" decides whether a possibly animated image is
    |    decoded as such or whether the animation is discarded.
    |
    | - "blendingColor" Defines the default blending color.
    |
    | - "strip" controls if meta data like exif tags should be removed when
    |    encoding images.
